  </span>
  <p>As the country changed, so did its census. The questions the census asks, how it’s administered, where the data ends up—all of these have undergone dramatic modifications since 1790. The various iterations of the census reflect transformations in the relationship between the government and its citizenry, in ideas about race and identity, in what makes an individual an American—and all the ways a person can count. <a href="https://medium.com/@ceciliasaixue/whos-counting-the-history-of-the-u-s-census-5a037343984b"><i><b>(Enigma)</b></i></a></p>
