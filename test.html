    <p><a href="http://www.vox.com/a/mass-shootings-calendar-2015">Apparently</a>, there have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/26/were-now-averaging-more-than-one-mass-shooting-per-day-in-2015/">more mass shootings</a> this year <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/03/us/how-often-do-mass-shootings-occur-on-average-every-day-records-show.html">than there have been days</a>. Maybe. There’s more to unpack here.</p>

    <p>It depends on what you classify as a mass shooting event.</p>

<p>And depending on these definitions, they can tell a few different narratives.</p>

<p>But here is the heart of the matter: how best do we frame these numbers to argue for or against gun control?</p>

<p>And here is another question: considering that mass shootings are actually very, very rare, why do they provoke so much more fear and anxiety in the American consciousness than shootings of the non-mass variety? Why do these incidents receive so much media attention when (thousands other) gun deaths are ignored? </p>

<p>Some hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mass shootings are more rare. People are more interested in rare things, like gemstones and collectibles.</li>
<li>Mass shootings take place in public (or semi-public) venues—schools, clinics, churches. They bring out the <em>it could happen to me</em> genre of disquiet.</li>
<li>Speaking of <em>it could happen to me</em>, there’s something about the arbitrariness of victims that marks them as especially innocent. Public mourning tends to require that victims be innocent: see, for instance, the response to the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting, where some commentators withheld their sympathy for women whom they considered murderers.</li>
<li>And this:</li>
</ul>

<p>Gun violence disproportionately affects people of color. Put another way: mass shooting incidents disproportionately affect white people.</p>
