<p>The year is 1988.</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan is in the last year of his presidency, the Soviet Union has begun <em>perestroika</em>, and al-Qaeda has just been founded. Laptop computers are emerging on the consumer market; the 3.5-inch floppy disk has become standard, replacing the older 5.25-inch disk; DOS is the most used operating system. <sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>And the Internet is about to lose its innocence.</p>

<p>Home computers have been on the market for a few years, but the Internet is in its nascent stages. Tim Berners-Lee has only just begun to talk about a “large hypertext database,” which in a couple of years will become the World Wide Web. <sup><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Commercial ISPs won’t appear for another few months. For now, the Internet is mostly available at government research sites and universities. Its size is uncharted, its potential unknown, its dangers untested.</p>

<p>On November 2, a Cornell Ph.D. candidate named Robert Morris writes a program and releases it on the Internet—or, as the Los Angeles Times writes, “an information network called INTERNET that connects more than 60,000 computers around the country.”<sup><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The program replicates itself, breaks into other conneted computers, and replicates again; in this way, it spreads across the network. It overloads the processes of infected computers, making them slow or entirely unable to operate.</p>

<p>Twelve hours later, researchers at UC Berkeley figure out how to stop the program’s spread. But damage is already done: in addition to hours of lost productivity, the cost of fixing the problem ranges from $200 to $53,000 per device. <sup><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup> John McAfee estimates the total damage as more than $100 million. <sup><a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>This is how Robert Morris becomes the first person to be indicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He is sentenced to 3 years of probation, a $10,050 fine, and 400 hours of community service. </p>

<p>His infectious program will later be variably referred to as the 1988 Internet Worm, the Morris Worm—or, sometimes, the Great Worm. It will prove to be “a sort of devastating watershed event in hacker history,” according to the Jargon File, a collection of computer slang and cultural lore compiled between 1975 and 2003. “Certainly it did more to make non-hackers nervous about the Internet than anything before or since.” <sup><a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Ten years earlier, another Robert Morris was having his own run-in with the United States government.</p>

<p>Born in 1932 in Boston, this Robert Morris studied mathematics at Harvard and became one of the pioneers of computer security. He spent 26 years as a researcher at Bell Labs, the historic laboratory responsible for many of the 20th century’s most significant developments in information technology, including the transistor, the laser, and the concept of information theory. Here, Morris worked on another Bell Labs innovation: the UNIX operating system, upon which Linux and Apple’s OS X are based. </p>

<p>Morris specialized in information security. He, along with fellow computer science pioneer Ken Thompson, designed a scheme for user authentication with passwords; variations on this design continue to be used today.<sup><a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Morris also wrote <em>crypt</em>, a program for encrypting data. He seemed to approach cryptography with a sense of whimsical curiosity; in private, he referred to his <em>crypt</em> commands as “a sequence of graded exercises.” <sup><a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Morris’ curiosity extended into rooting around junk stores in lower Manhattan, where he managed to find an old cipher machine, known as an M&#8211;209 by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. </p>

<p>The M&#8211;209 was used by the U.S. military during World War II, a sort of American corollary to the German ENIGMA machine. Approximately the size of a breadbox, the M&#8211;209 looked like a strange typewriter. An operator would enter messages into the machine, letter by letter, by turning a dial. The operator would then turn a hand crank to print encoded text onto paper tape. Entering the encoded text into an M&#8211;209 with the same settings would output the deciphered original message.</p>

<p>By 1943, the German Intercept Service was beginning to figure out how to break the M&#8211;209’s security—how to decipher a message without knowing the initial settings. The M&#8211;209 had been developed for the U.S. military, but the mathematics of its encryption scheme had not been thoroughly analyzed. This changed sometime after 1970: Robert Morris was on the case. <sup><a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> </p>

<p>Working in conjunction with mathematician Jim Reeds as well as another Bell Labs luminary, Dennis Ritchie, Morris and his collaborators solved it: they were able to take M&#8211;209 encrypted messages and decrypt them with no <em>a priori</em> knowledge—what in cryptography is known as a ciphertext-only attack. Around 1978, they submitted their findings to the academic journal Cryptologia.</p>

<p>Morris and Ritchie then received a visit. It was from a man Morris would describe as “a retired gentleman from Virginia,” later referred to as simply “RG” by Ritchie. </p>

<p>The retired gentleman was from the National Security Agency. Apparently, though they were not particularly invested in maintaining the security of the M&#8211;209, the NSA was concerned that the methods that Morris and his partners—particularly Reeds—had used would also apply to certain cryptographic systems in current use. And so, the NSA was discreetly requesting that they not publish their findings. </p>

<p>No threats were made, but the paper was withheld from publication. Ritchie in particular was left with the impression that they had “shaken a velvet-gloved hand on friendly terms and sensed that there was steel underneath.”<sup><a href="#fn:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>—</p>

<p>The story does not end here.</p>

<p>During their meeting, the retired gentleman also remarked that their work was impressive, and offered that Morris, Reeds, and Ritchie might consult for the NSA some time. </p>

<p>In 1986, Robert Morris joined the NSA.<sup><a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Two years later, his son Robert released the first Internet worm.</p>
